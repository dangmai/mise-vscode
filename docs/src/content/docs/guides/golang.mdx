Here are the steps to set up Go in VS Code with mise:

<Steps>
1. Install the [mise-vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hverlin.mise-vscode#overview) (if not already installed)
1. Install the [Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go) for VS Code
1. Open a project with a `mise.toml` file (or any other files supported by mise)
</Steps>

If your project does not have a `mise.toml` file, you can create one using:
- the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`). Search for `Mise: use tool`. Select `mise.toml` and then `go`
- or by running `mise use go` in the terminal

`mise-vscode` will automatically detect the Go tools in your project and configure the Go extension to use them.
