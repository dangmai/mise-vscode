### Do I need to update my default shell's profile script to use this extension?

You do not have to update your default shell's profile script to use this extension. This extension will automatically detect `mise`, even if not activated and configure other extensions to use tools provided by `mise`.

Mise environment variables will also be loaded to your current VSCode session.
